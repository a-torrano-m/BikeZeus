    "## QUESTION 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A heatmap painted over the map of Gracia district was considered the most visual and human understandable source of information to made explicit the quality of bike stations across the district. A first approach would have led to produce some histograms or density plots depicting the distribution of available bikes for each station. But, heatmaps, besides giving a quick first glance of quality and depletion, can introduce space and inter-station neighbourhood information. If I stick only to depletion metrics concerning each station I get an insolated perspective. I could get a biased decision because a good quality station could be surrounded by bad bike stations. So, my B-plan could be catasthopic in case one morning I find my station depleted of bikes, because my nearby surrounding station most probably will also be depleted. On the other hand, a heatmap will expose the quality of each station plus its nearby surrounding stations. So a good decission is based on chosing a good station surrounded by other good/mid quality station which work as a good alternative plans. \n",

    "The script will access to a bunch of data which was sampled along 24h. The samples are spaced by 5 minutes intervals. The script is not focusing on counting mean of free bikes but counting amount of segments where the station had zero bikes to offer. The database is a list of snapshots consisting of a timestamp, the list of Gracia district stations and another list with the neighbour stations whether they belong to Gracia or not. For each snapshot a table will sum the zerosegments (no bikes during 5 minutes). Such amount will induce a \"hot spot\" which will contribute to the heat of each station. The spots are spread randomly uniform around each station. The more zerosegments a station has, the more heat is amassed around the station.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Heatmap Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Stations with high amount of zerosegments will sum up high amounts of heat. The good choice is to settle nearby cold stations, blueish or greenish. Very high quality stations will be extremely cold and will almost paint no heat trace on the map. This will make seem similar two kind of streets. First kind are streets very near to top quality stations; and second kind of streets which are far away of any station. The second type is indeed a not good one. The user would live away from any station giving him a bad commute time. Such issue motivates to introduce \"inverse heat\". \n",
    "\n",
    "# Inverse Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "Heatmaps depict and stress interesting entities giving a positive incremental qualitative measure. Stressing bad quality stations with a heatmap gives us an uncomplete picture of the setting. You can see above it is ambiguous about marking streets nearby high quality stations from isolated streets away of any station. The proposal is to give heat to high quality stations. The measure of amount of zeroSegments is updated to a complementary value. High quality stations will be enclosed in a cloud of heat, and thereby all the interesting streets around it will also be stressed by the heat cloud. \n",

    "# Inverse Heatmap Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The new metric will show with equal cold temperature streets near a bad station as streets far away from any station.\n",
    "The user will guide its decission on highest temperature areas. It should be advisable to land on some mid point between high quality station, but not too far away from a prefered one.\n",
