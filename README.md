## Bikes Assignment in notebooks ##

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/a-torrano-m/BikeZeus/master)

BikeZeus is a repository of all my Jupyter Notebooks for assignment on bikes.
Each Jupyter contains python code and/or text solving each one of the questions.
Besides, some notebooks will render heatmaps on the fly ( please follow [launch|BINDER] link above ).
So, there is no need to download any source code and run it in local. 

Directory contents:

#data/HOSCO# 	: MongoDB dump files for retrieved snapshots of stations. Each five minutes during 
twenty four hours.

#html# 		: Target directory where script from Question 2 sends rendered heatmaps as html files.

#img#  		: Some figures used by the Jupyter Notebooks.

#src#  		: Source directory. There is a subdirectory for each question. Scripts must be ran from 
    their own directory.

#./BikesNotebook_question0.ipynb# 	: Data retrieval part for answering question 2.

#./BikesNotebook_question1.ipynb#	: Answer to question 1.

#./BikesNotebook_question2.ipynb#	: Answer to question 2 ( follow above [launch-BINDER] link 
in order to get the embedded maps and figures).

#./BikesNotebook_question3.ipynb#	: Answer to question 3, plain explation with a simple diagram.

#./README.md#	 			: This file.

#./environment.yml#			: configuration file for BINDER environment.
